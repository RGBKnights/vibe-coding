## Manage permissions and security

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type        | Example                | Approval Required | ‚ÄùYes, don‚Äôt ask again‚Äù Behavior |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Read-only        | File reads, LS, Grep   | No                | N/A                             |
| Bash Commands    | Shell execution        | Yes               | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification| Edit/write files       | Yes               | Until session end               |

## Protect against prompt injection

Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker attempts to override or manipulate an AI assistant‚Äôs instructions by inserting malicious text. Claude Code includes several safeguards against these attacks:

- Permission system: Sensitive operations require explicit approval
- Context-aware analysis: Detects potentially harmful instructions by analyzing the full request
- Input sanitization: Prevents command injection by processing user inputs
- Command blocklist: Blocks risky commands that fetch arbitrary content from the web like curl and wget

Best practices for working with untrusted content:
- Review suggested commands before approval
- Avoid piping untrusted content directly to Claude
- Verify proposed changes to critical files
- Report suspicious behavior with /bug

[!WARNING]
While these protections significantly reduce risk, no system is completely immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices when working with any AI tool.

## Set up Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables LLMs to access external tools and data sources. For more details, see the MCP documentation.

[!WARNING]
Use third party MCP servers at your own risk. Make sure you trust the MCP servers, and be especially careful when using MCP servers that talk to the internet, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.
